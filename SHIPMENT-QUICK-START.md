# Shipment Management Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites
Before you can use the shipment management system, ensure you have:
1. Backend server running (`npm run start:dev`)
2. MongoDB connected
3. An admin or super admin account created

## Step 1: Create an Admin Account

If you don't have an admin account yet, use the provided script:

```bash
node create-super-admin.js
```

Or manually create one through the API after logging in with your first super admin account.

## Step 2: Login as Admin

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/admin/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@mey.com",
    "password": "your-admin-password"
  }'
```

Save the `accessToken` from the response. You'll need it for all subsequent requests.

## Step 3: Create Your First Shipment

### Example: Shein Shipment

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "Ahmed Ali",
    "customerPhone": "+964 770 123 4567",
    "customerAddress": {
      "street": "Al-Karrada Street, Building 15",
      "city": "Baghdad",
      "province": "Baghdad",
      "country": "Iraq"
    },
    "platform": "shein",
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "Summer Dress",
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 15000
      },
      {
        "name": "Fashion Sandals",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": 20000
      }
    ],
    "weight": 2.5
  }'
```

**What happens automatically:**
- âœ… Tracking number generated: `MEY-SHEIN-XXXXXXXXX`
- âœ… Cart price calculated: 50,000 IQD (from items)
- âœ… Shipment fee calculated: 6,500 IQD (weight-based)
- âœ… Delivery fee added: 5,000 IQD
- âœ… Total price: 61,500 IQD
- âœ… Status set to: `pending`

## Step 4: View All Shipments

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Filter by Status

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments?status=pending" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Search by Customer Name

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments?search=Ahmed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Step 5: Update Shipment Status

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments/SHIPMENT_ID/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "status": "confirmed",
    "notes": "Order confirmed and ready for packing"
  }'
```

### Status Workflow

1. `pending` â†’ Customer placed order
2. `confirmed` â†’ Order confirmed by admin
3. `packed` â†’ Items packed and ready
4. `shipped` â†’ Handed to carrier
5. `in_transit` â†’ On the way
6. `out_for_delivery` â†’ Out for final delivery
7. `delivered` â†’ Successfully delivered

## Step 6: Calculate Price Preview

Before creating a shipment, you can preview the price:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments/calculate-price \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "shein",
    "cartPrice": 50000,
    "weight": 2.5,
    "materialCost": 5000
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "cartPrice": 50000,
  "shipmentFee": 6500,
  "materialCost": 5000,
  "deliveryFee": 5000,
  "totalPrice": 66500,
  "platform": "shein",
  "weight": 2.5
}
```

## Step 7: View Shipment Statistics

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments/statistics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Common Scenarios

### Creating Shipment with Manual Price

If you need to set a custom price (discount, special offer, etc.):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "Sara Mohammed",
    "customerPhone": "+964 771 999 8888",
    "customerAddress": {
      "street": "Main Street 10",
      "city": "Erbil",
      "province": "Erbil",
      "country": "Iraq"
    },
    "platform": "amazon",
    "items": [{"name": "Electronics", "quantity": 1, "price": 100000}],
    "weight": 3.0,
    "priceOverride": true,
    "cartPrice": 100000,
    "shipmentFee": 8000,
    "materialCost": 5000,
    "deliveryFee": 5000,
    "totalPrice": 115000
  }'
```

### Linking to Registered User

If the customer has an account in your system:

```json
{
  "userId": "USER_MONGO_ID",
  "customerName": "Ahmed Ali",
  ...
}
```

### Adding Package Dimensions

```json
{
  ...
  "dimensions": {
    "length": 30,
    "width": 20,
    "height": 10,
    "unit": "cm"
  }
}
```

### Setting Estimated Delivery Date

```json
{
  ...
  "estimatedDeliveryDate": "2025-10-25"
}
```

### Marking as Delivered

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/admin/shipments/SHIPMENT_ID/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "status": "delivered",
    "actualDeliveryDate": "2025-10-24",
    "notes": "Delivered successfully to customer"
  }'
```

2. Click "Authorize" button
3. Enter: `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
4. Click "Authorize"
5. Now you can test all endpoints with a nice UI!

## Filter Examples

### By Date Range
```
GET /admin/shipments?startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-31
```

### By Platform and Status
```
GET /admin/shipments?platform=shein&status=shipped
```

### Search with Multiple Filters
```
GET /admin/shipments?platform=amazon&status=in_transit&search=Ahmed
```

## Tips

1. **Always use status updates** - Keep customers informed by updating shipment status
2. **Use internal notes** - Track important details that customers shouldn't see
3. **Check price preview** - Use calculate-price endpoint before creating shipments
4. **Search is powerful** - Search works on tracking number, customer name, and phone
5. **Track statistics** - Monitor your business with the statistics endpoint
